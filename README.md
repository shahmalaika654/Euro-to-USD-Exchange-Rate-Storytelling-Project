## Euro to USD Exchange Rate Storytelling Project

### Overview
This repository features a data storytelling project that examines the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate from 1999 to 2020. Using Python and Matplotlib, the project visualizes exchange rate trends and analyzes key events, such as the 2007-2008 financial crisis and exchange rate shifts during different U.S. presidencies.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into several key sections:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** 
   - Initial data loading, cleaning, and exploration.
   
2. **Visualizing Exchange Rate Data:** 
   - Creating visualizations of exchange rate data with Matplotlib.
   
3. **Analyzing the Financial Crisis:** 
   - Focused analysis on the 2007-2008 financial crisis with key highlights.
   
4. **Applying a Stylish Theme:** 
   - Enhancing plot presentation with a customized theme.
   
5. **Refining the Financial Crisis Plot:** 
   - Further refinements, including annotations and styling, to the financial crisis plot.
   
6. **Adding Attribution and Sources:** 
   - Providing proper attribution and source information for data and visuals.
   
7. **Highlighting the Financial Crisis Period:** 
   - Using `axvspan` to visually highlight the financial crisis period.
   
8. **Analyzing Different US Presidents' Terms:** 
   - Dividing data by presidential terms, adding custom tick labels, and annotations.
   
9. **Creating a Composite Plot:** 
   - Generating a composite plot overlaying exchange rate data for multiple U.S. presidents.
   
10. **Conclusion and Attribution:** 
    - Summarizing key takeaways and providing final attribution and source details.
